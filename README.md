# Tampered-File-Integrity-Check
Utility designed to run on host directory and check for file signatures and compare it against known viral databases (as well as virusTotal). For files that are obfuscated or masked, disassemblers like OllyDBG and IDApro are to check the function behavior inside the payload to identify malicious behavior.
